batchy is a [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1400142280236171063/batchy) to make your exports more comfortable. Instead of just using the layer name and getting the layer size, you will now be able to write your own asset name dynamically and export your assets in screen sizes, if needed.
